It's a Simple Space Simulator.
The code was implemented in C++ using OpenGL (Freeglut) for graphics.  
The objects move automatically and have no textures, only RGB colors.  
There are 2 types of shading: flat and Gouraud. You can also turn the lights on and off.  
The simulation starts without shading and is controlled with the "I" key.  
There are 3 lights, which can be controlled with keys 1, 2, and 3.  
The other keyboard functions are explained in the simulation window.
